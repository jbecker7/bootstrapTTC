# boostrap Teeny Tiny compiler

I went through this [fantastic tutorial](https://austinhenley.com/blog/teenytinycompiler1.html) on how to make a BASIC-to-C compiler in Python. Now I want to extend it by bootstrapping it. Since the version of BASIC used in the original tutorial was simplified, I will start by extending the language so that I can write the compiler. After that I might make a subset of the language that I can use as the target so that I can have every part of the project use this version of BASIC.
